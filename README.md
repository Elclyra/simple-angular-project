# Simple Angular to do list

## What I learned
During this project I learned to use ngFor/ngModel/ngSubmit. I also made animations for adding or removing something from the to do list.

## What I used
I used Typescript and Sass for writing scripts and styling the page.

## Contributions
This project was heavily inspired and lots of the code taken from a Freecodecamp tutorial.
